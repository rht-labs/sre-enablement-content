### 🐈 A Little Bit Backstory
_Something something_ Inc. is an entertaiment company that creates games to make people happy! With xx number of people...
A couple of developers from the company created this fun app for their friends and families: PetBattle. They hacked around with so that the authors can Cat versus Cat battle each other in a simple online forum. A My cat is better than your cat type of thing. There are very few bells and whistles to the initial architecture — there is a simple web-based user interface and an API layer coupled with a NoSQL database.

One day, they realize that their app becomes a big hit! Nearly overnight, there was a drastically increased number of players, the PetBattle server crashes, and malicious pictures of not cats start appearing on the child-friendly application. 

The company had decided to own the app and developing a business around it, so developers had started an exciting journey embracing DevOps Culture and Practices. After a couple of months, they turned this simple hobbist app into a good business.

### 😎 All the cool kids are using Pet Battle!
Now that PetBattle became super hype, the development team started having hard times to keeping up with the feature requests or bugs reports while maintain the app on production. Incidents started to occur due to ? (high load, lack of high availability etc?) They needed to figure out things like scalability, operability, reliability to match with their customers and internal end users needs! (yes, there are other services depend on PetBattle now!)
