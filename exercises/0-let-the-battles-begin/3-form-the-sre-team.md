## New Brand SRE Team
For the sake of the story, this team is formed to support PetBattle in production but over time, team can support additional hype games as well! And it is not just about managing apps in production. SRE practices and SRE mindset can help the company for future decisions and strategy.

### What we need?
Forming a new team is not an easy task. A team needs autonomy, psychological safety and visualization of work. And we have just the right practices for that! 
* Another shout out to DO500 maybe

Mobius loop and summary of practices.. 

After some times, maybe an Empathy Maps to define how SREs are seen by devs?
