### Before Onboarding Pet Battle
PetBattle has been running on 

### What do you need to create PRR?
Well, not much :) This will be a checklist that you go through in order to confidently say "OK, this service is ready for live customer requests!" And as everything, this is a process which means it'll evolve over time. Start by deciding what 'readiness' mean for your organization. **A practice from OPL**

In our scenario, PetBattle is already serving to the endusers. You can use this checklist to identify the improvement points, do a prioritization with the development team and create a backlog.

Generate the topics based on your readiness definition. When you agreed as a team, go through PetBattle and make a decision.

Anything you can automate in this process? 


Not just PetBattle but maybe create a PRR for infrastructure??
