### Incident Management
One of the most important principles of SRE is "Failure is inevitable, but you can always learn from it"

*some intro to Incident Management*
WIP:
What really is the Incident Management? In short, it's a set of processes, guidelines, do's and dont's and all other things you can think of that get used or get triggered when you identify or get notified of issue with your Application. How it looks is determined by the business your application is handling and can be anything between a "in case of DB being dropped call Bob" sticky and a full fledged corporate document giving precise steps to follow in case of anything. Most important thing is that it gives the person answering the incident call basic information on what organization expects to happen when issue arrises. As all of SRE practices, it's also subject for frequent reviews and improvements.


As everything, incident management is a process too which means you'll get better when you practice. On the other hand, frequent incidents are undesirable :) But we can simulate a failure and do some role playing!

So, let's get started!
